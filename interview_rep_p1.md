## Study design

### Participants

We selected 15 participants based on socio-economic status, we used annual expenditure to classify the status based on Susenas survey (2016). Based on the value of expenditure per day per capita, our participants fall in middle class under the following subclass:

- middle = USD 5 - USD 10 = 5 participants
- middle-low = USD 2 - USD 4 = 10 participants

We also used educational level to classify our participants in to the following class and subclass:

- mid level education = high school = 5 participants
- high leve education = undergraduate = 10 participants 

### Questions

We asked the participants to answer the following questions:

1. where do your source of water come from? subquestions: `(1.1)` how far it is from your house? (in case of groundwater spring as source), `(1.2)` how deep is the water well? (in case of groundwater well as source), `(1.3)` how did you drill the well?, `(1.4)` did you hire a proper drilling expert?, `(1.5)` is your water source changing over years, or do you still have the same source of water in your period of living in the current house?
2. how do you determine it is consumable? subquestions: `(2.1)` do you have a physical criteria? `(2.2)` do you have chemical criteria? `(2.3)` do you test your water in the lab? `(2.4)` where did you get the skill?
3. how do you describe the water usage in your household? subquestions: `(3.1)` do you use it for cooking and drinking? `(3.2)` how do you prepare your drinking water? `(3.3)` where did you get the skill?
4. do you aware of any record of sickness in the family or neighbourhood due to water quality or the suspicion of water contamination? subquestions: `(4.1)` did you recall any sickness (digestional or skin) that related to water contamination? `(4.2)` did you remember how it started? `(4.3)`did you believe that it was the result of water contamination?
5. do you think you would change your water source or water usage? subquestions: `(5.1)` changing water source, `(5.2)` changing water usage.

We'd like to convey the following results:

- most of the participants (11/15) have two water sources: groundwater and PDAM, however most of them (8/11) use PDAM as the main source of water, while groundwater from dug wells are used as complementary water source. 
- 4/15 participants have dual source of water, groundwater and PDAM. Half of them (2/4) only use PDAM for drinking and cooking, and groundwater for bathing and washing and other usage; and the other half use groundwater for drinking and cooking, while PDAM for bathing and washing. This is simply due to the high content of kaporit in the PDAM water, based on  `color-odour-taste` test.
- Only 4/15 participants have only groundwater from dug well as their water source.  They use it because they are still satisfied with the quality, although the PDAM is actively at service in their area. But they do complaint about the quality of service of PDAM, which only active several hours per day. 
- All of the participants have tested the water (both for groundwater and PDAM) using `color-odour-taste` test before deciding to use it as their main water source. All of them use the techniques based on their family education, not from formal education, eg: health education from school. 
- All of participants using groundwater and PDAM boil the water prior to later usage, eg: for drinking and cooking.
